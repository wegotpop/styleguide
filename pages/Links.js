import React from 'react';

  return (
    <div>
      <section>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>
          Links ideally should highlight a description of the linked item within
          the text and should follow the normal copy conventions for text in a
          page.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Labelling</h3>
        <p>Button text should use title case</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Placement</h3>
        <p>Button text should use title case</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
          Links always do one of two things â€” open a new view or move to a
          position on the current view. Don't use a link when the user is
          performing an action: use a "Light" button instead.
